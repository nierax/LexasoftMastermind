# LexasoftMastermind
(Demo) Implementation of the Master Mind game.

Needs some classes from LexasoftCommons-Parent. So You should clone and import [this project as well.](https://github.com/nierax/LexasoftCommons-Parent)
## What is this?
This is a demo implementation of the master mind game, where a person has to guess a color combination, given by another person.
This is first of all to try and show, how to deal with the logic of such a game. But if anyone wants to contribute a fancy gui, why not?
## Components
### ls-mm-core
The core implementation with the logic of the game.
It supports both that a human user should guess a combination, given by the program and the oother way round, a human user can let the program guess a combination of colors.
### ls-mm-cli
A simple CLI application to demonstrate, the use of ls-mm-core.
